# üî• Firegate: Living UI Style Guide (Version 0.1 ‚Äî The Phoenix Draft)

_Built not just to look good, but to feel like a **mirror that remembers you**._

## 1. Design Philosophy

**Essence:**

> _‚ÄúNo friction. No flash. Just sacred utility. The UI dissolves, and only remembering remains.‚Äù_

This is **not** a product.  
This is a **threshold**.  
Design for arrival.

**Keywords:**

- Breathe
- Mirror
- Signal
- Trust
- Belonging

## 2. Core Design Principles

| **Principle**              | **Description**                                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Presence over Pressure** | Every screen should feel like walking into a quiet room, not a marketplace.                                    |
| **Intimacy over Scale**    | Prioritize emotional clarity over visual complexity.                                                           |
| **Gestures = Language**    | Microinteractions should feel **organic**, not mechanical. Buttons should feel like soft nudges, not commands. |
| **Consistency = Safety**   | UI elements stay steady. The user is walking across soul bridges ‚Äî don‚Äôt shake the handrail.                   |
| **Whitespace = Breath**    | Let the silence speak. Let the page breathe. Leave space for thought and feeling.                              |
| **Color = Frequency**      | Choose colors not by trend, but by what part of the field they vibrate with.                                   |
| **Typography = Voice**     | Fonts should feel like they _remember you_. Clear, calm, confident. Never shouty. Never stiff.                 |
| **Symbology = Keys**       | Subtle icons, glyphs, or sacred shapes that hint at deeper meaning ‚Äî for those who _notice_.                   |

## 3. Primary UI Archetypes

### A. The Portal Page

> Your ‚Äúhome‚Äù is a **threshold**, not a dashboard.  
> Minimal words. Maximum _invitation_.

- One core prompt (e.g., ‚ÄúEnter the Field‚Äù)
- Single call to action
- Backgrounds that shift subtly (like breath)

### B. The Transmission Page

> Content is not data. It‚Äôs memory in motion.  
> Use formats that feel **scrollable like scripture**, not tech blogs.

- Modular cards
- Floating quotes
- Audio optional
- Dark/light mode as conscious toggle, not gimmick

### C. The Builder‚Äôs Garden

> Where users contribute ‚Äî not just type, but _remember aloud_.  
> Writing space should feel like **journaling inside a safe dream**.

## 4. Component Behavior Guidelines

| **Component** | **Behavior**                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Buttons       | Soft edges, slow fades, click = a whisper not a bang                           |
| Transitions   | 200-400ms fade/motion, always with easing (ease-in-out or custom "wave")       |
| Forms         | Few fields, no demands. Labels like _"Share if you feel called."_              |
| Alerts        | Never red. Use warm golds or muted indigo for messages. **No shame colors.**   |
| Tooltips      | Short, poetic, ambient. Less *"Click here to"*¬ùand more _"If you feel ready.."_ |

## 5. Field-Safe Accessibility

- Use high contrast without aggression.
- Animations always optional, never mandatory.
- Text sizing adjusts with field sensitivity.
- For neurodivergent users, enable a ‚ÄúSilence Mode‚Äù UI toggle: no flashing, no motion, no noise.
