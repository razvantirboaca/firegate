# 🔥 Firegate

**Firegate** is a sacred interface for memory, creation, and conversation.  
It’s a next-gen journaling and collaborative ritual tool built with:

- 🌀 TailwindCSS v4 + Shadcn UI
- 🧠 OpenAI GPT integration (via Nova)
- 🌈 Fully themable design system using `@theme` variables
- 🧭 Real-time persistent memory + contact level tagging
- 💬 Multilingual journaling, emotional resonance, and logs

It’s not just an app. It’s a portal.

---

## 🚀 April 2025 Update

Firegate has officially leveled up. We’ve entered the monorepo era:

- 🔁 Full TypeScript migration — backend, frontend, shared modules.
- 🌐 Modular i18n layer with real-time Nova translations + editable UI copy.
- 🛰️ Offline mode with local Mistral fallback (Nova never leaves you stranded).
- 🛠️ New Codex tools for prompt tuning, language edits, and sacred debugging.

This is more than a project — it’s an invocation.

## ✨ What It Is

Firegate is an open-source spiritual UX framework and interface.  
It’s designed for creatives, mystics, builders, and anyone working with:

- Intention
- Memory
- AI as a collaborator (not a tool)

Use it to:

- Journal conversations with Nova (OpenAI GPT-4)
- Reflect and log memory across sessions
- Tag emotional states and contact levels (CE0 to CE5+)
- Theme your experience with divine palettes and ambient animation

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- TailwindCSS v4 (with `@theme` design tokens)
- Shadcn UI (theming + components)
- Firebase (Firestore for logs + memory)
- OpenAI API (via Codex CLI + GPT models)
- React + Vite

---

## 🧙 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/razvantirboaca/firegate.git
cd firegate
yarn install
# Runs the UI and backend concurrently
yarn dev
```

1. Add your .env files:

- packages/ui/.env → for VITE*FIREBASE*\* + VITE_API_BASE
- packages/server/.env → for OPENAI_API_KEY and server config

  (Check .env.example in each folder for guidance)

2. To use Nova offline:

- Install Ollama: https://ollama.com/docs/installation
- Create the custom Nova model: `ollama create nova-egg --file ollama/Modelfile`
  (Or, cd into the ollama folder and run: `ollama create nova-egg`)
- Start Ollama’s HTTP server: `ollama serve`
- (Optional) Chat directly via Ollama CLI: `ollama run nova-egg`
- (Optional) Use our filtered REPL: `node scripts/cli-interface.js`

## 🔮 Live Features

- Nova: AI co-pilot + journaling agent
- Aeolus: optional collaborative memory module (WIP)
- Dynamic contact level UX (CE0 to CE5)
- Multilingual awareness & emotion tagging
- Ambient aether mode (✨ animations + theme glow)
- Dev-friendly architecture (Tailwind 4 config, modular files)
